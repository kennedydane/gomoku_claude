---

## **TDD Principles Being Followed**

### **Red-Green-Refactor Cycle**
1. **RED**: Write a failing test that defines desired functionality
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
4. **DOCUMENT**: Update TODO.md after each cycle

### **Test Categories**
- **Unit Tests**: Individual view functions and template rendering
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end web workflows
- **Functional Tests**: JavaScript/htmx interactions
- **UI Tests**: Responsive design and user experience

### **Quality Gates**
- All existing 222 tests must continue passing
- New web tests must achieve >95% success rate
- All views must have corresponding test coverage
- All templates must be tested for proper rendering

---

## **Technical Stack**

### **Frontend Technologies**
- **htmx**: Dynamic HTML interactions without complex JavaScript
- **Bootstrap 5**: Responsive design and component library
- **Alpine.js**: Minimal JavaScript for local state management
- **CSS Grid**: Flexible game board layout

### **Backend Integration**
- **Django Templates**: Server-side rendering with context
- **Crispy Forms**: Beautiful form rendering with Bootstrap
- **Django Views**: Class-based views following Django patterns
- **existing APIs**: Leverage existing game/user/challenge endpoints

### **Testing Tools**
- **Django Test Framework**: Built-in testing with database isolation
- **Django Client**: Test HTTP requests and responses
- **Factory Boy**: Generate test data using existing factories
- **Coverage**: Monitor test coverage across web interface

## **Development Commands**

### **TDD Development Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Write failing test
uv run python manage.py test web.tests.test_views::TestHomeView::test_home_page_renders

# 2. Run test to see it fail (RED)
uv run python manage.py test web.tests

# 3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
# Edit web/views.py to make test pass

# 4. Run test to see it pass
uv run python manage.py test web.tests

# 5. Refactor and run all tests
uv run python manage.py test

# 6. Update TODO.md with progress
```

### **Development Server**
```bash
uv run python manage.py runserver 8001   # Backend with web interface
# Access web interface at http://localhost:8001/web/
```
