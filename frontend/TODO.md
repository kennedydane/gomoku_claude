- [ ] Implement profile switching interface
- [ ] Add account settings (change password, email, display name)
- [ ] Create profile deletion with confirmation
- [ ] Implement account registration flow in GUI
- [ ] Add profile backup/export functionality
- [ ] Create multi-account management interface

### Phase 1C.12: GUI Documentation ⏳ Pending
**Goal**: Document GUI authentication features and usage

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Update README.md with GUI authentication guide
- [ ] Create user guide for authentication features  
- [ ] Document configuration options for GUI applications
- [ ] Add screenshots and usage examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend Authentication System:
├── AuthManager (Core authentication coordinator)
├── ConfigManager (Configuration from JSON/.env files)  
├── APIClient (HTTP client with auto-auth integration)
└── Models (Pydantic data structures)
```

### Test Coverage Status
- **52 Tests Total** - All Passing ✅
- **AuthManager**: 16 tests covering login, registration, token refresh, profiles
- **API Client**: 16 tests covering authenticated requests, auto-refresh, error handling  
- **ConfigManager**: 16 tests covering JSON, env vars, validation, backup/restore
- **Integration**: 4 tests covering complete workflows

### Configuration System
```bash
# Environment Variables (highest priority)
GOMOKU_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
GOMOKU_TIMEOUT=30.0
GOMOKU_AUTO_REFRESH_TOKEN=true
GOMOKU_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# JSON Config (medium priority)
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:8001",
  "timeout": 30.0,
  "profiles": {...}
}

# Pydantic Defaults (lowest priority)
```

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Post-v1.0)

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Implement credential encryption for saved profiles
- [ ] Add two-factor authentication support
- [ ] Implement session timeout and idle detection
- [ ] Add password strength requirements and validation
- [ ] Create audit logging for authentication events

### User Experience
- [ ] Add dark/light theme support
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for all auth operations
- [ ] Add accessibility features (screen reader support, high contrast)
- [ ] Create guided onboarding for new users
- [ ] Add offline mode with local credentials

### Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement OAuth2/SSO integration
- [ ] Add biometric authentication (if supported)
- [ ] Create admin interface for user management
- [ ] Add bulk operations for profile management
- [ ] Implement user groups and permissions

### Performance & Monitoring
- [ ] Add authentication metrics and analytics
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for API client
- [ ] Add request/response caching
- [ ] Create performance monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Add automated testing for UI components

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- GUI integration not yet complete (Phase 1C in progress)
- No biometric authentication support
- Limited offline functionality
- No admin interface for user management

### Technical Debt
- Legacy GUI code (`simple_gomoku.py`) needs authentication integration
- Configuration validation could be more comprehensive
- Error messages could be more user-friendly
- Test coverage for GUI components needs improvement

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow TDD methodology: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Maintain 100% test coverage for authentication components
- Use Pydantic models for all data structures
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Follow async/await patterns consistently

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have corresponding tests
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP requests, file I/O)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate configuration loading and error handling

### Documentation Standards
- Update README.md for all user-facing features
- Document all configuration options
- Provide code examples for programmatic usage
- Include troubleshooting information
- Keep TODO.md current with development progress

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- [ ] Users can login/logout through GUI
- [ ] Registration works through GUI interface
- [ ] Profile switching is available in GUI
- [ ] Authentication state is clearly visible
- [ ] All authentication features have GUI equivalents
- [ ] Error handling provides clear user feedback
- [ ] Documentation covers all GUI features

### Overall Project Success
