- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Automatic refresh when games window opens or authentication changes

## 🚧 Current Phase: 1C.12 - GUI Documentation

### Phase 1C.12: GUI Documentation ⏳ In Progress
**Goal**: Document complete GUI features including authentication and game management

**Tasks**:
- ✅ Update README.md with complete GUI feature guide
- ✅ Document game management interface and multi-game workflow
- ✅ Create user guide for authentication and game switching features  
- ✅ Document configuration options for GUI applications
- [ ] Add screenshots and usage examples for all major features
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Revised Project Direction

**Key Decision**: User profile management (password changes, account settings, etc.) will be handled by the web application, not duplicated in the desktop GUI. The desktop app focuses on **game experience** rather than account management.

**Desktop App Core Value**: Multi-game management, quick game switching, and dedicated gaming interface - features that are harder to achieve in a web browser environment.

### Current Architecture
```
Frontend Authentication System:
├── AuthManager (Core authentication coordinator)
├── ConfigManager (Configuration from JSON/.env files)  
├── APIClient (HTTP client with auto-auth integration)
└── Models (Pydantic data structures)
```

### Test Coverage Status
- **79+ Tests Total** - All Passing ✅
- **AuthManager**: 16 tests covering login, registration, token refresh, profiles
- **API Client**: 16 tests covering authenticated requests, auto-refresh, error handling  
- **ConfigManager**: 16 tests covering JSON, env vars, validation, backup/restore
- **Game Management**: 27 tests covering filtering, sorting, status display, UI integration
- **Integration**: 4 tests covering complete workflows

### Configuration System
```bash
# Environment Variables (highest priority)
GOMOKU_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001
GOMOKU_TIMEOUT=30.0
GOMOKU_AUTO_REFRESH_TOKEN=true
GOMOKU_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# JSON Config (medium priority)
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:8001",
  "timeout": 30.0,
  "profiles": {...}
}

# Pydantic Defaults (lowest priority)
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- GUI integration not yet complete (Phase 1C in progress)
- No biometric authentication support
- Limited offline functionality
- No admin interface for user management

### Technical Debt
- Legacy GUI code (`simple_gomoku.py`) needs authentication integration
- Configuration validation could be more comprehensive
- Error messages could be more user-friendly
- Test coverage for GUI components needs improvement

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow TDD methodology: RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
- Maintain 100% test coverage for authentication components
- Use Pydantic models for all data structures
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Follow async/await patterns consistently

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have corresponding tests
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Mock external dependencies (HTTP requests, file I/O)
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Validate configuration loading and error handling

### Documentation Standards
- Update README.md for all user-facing features
- Document all configuration options
- Provide code examples for programmatic usage
- Include troubleshooting information
- Keep TODO.md current with development progress
